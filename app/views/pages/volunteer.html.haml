            There isn't, yet, a way to automatically get the voting data from the Dublin City Council website. So these data have been plugged in by hand, by staff at the local independent newspaper, [Dublin Inquirer](https://www.dublininquirer.com), and its community of readers.

            Each month, we ask the folks at Dublin City Council for copies of the voting sheets for meetings that have taken place. We have a [Facebook (yes, yes, #deletefacebook ðŸ˜¬) group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/233775687189015/) of volunteers who then input that data.

            We've tried to make it as easy as possible to understand what the vote was about. After a vote has been loaded up, we at Dublin Inquirer double-check that entry. If you're interested in getting involved in that process, you can email us at [info@dublininquirer.com](mailto:info@dublininquirer.com), and we'll add you to the inner circle. Thanks for your interest!
